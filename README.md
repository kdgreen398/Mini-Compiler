# Mini-Compiler
University Assignment

The purpose of this assignment was to design a small compiler that works with a particular language created for this project.

Language syntax:
Currently there are only 3 varibles(<var>) oif integer type that can be initalized: A, B, C


Programs must start with the BEGIN keyword and end with the END keyword
Variable Declaration: <var> = <var> | <expression> ;
Expression: <var> + | - | * | / <var>
User input: input <var> ;
printing to console: display <var> | <string> ;

Example Code:

Begin

	A = 5;
	B = 10;
	B = A / B;
	
	display "The sum of A + B is: ";
	display C;


End
